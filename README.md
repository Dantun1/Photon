## Description

A Deep Learning framework with an imperative style API, similar to PyTorch. 

Implements a dynamic computational graph in Python that dispatches heavy arithmetic operations to 
an optimized C++/CUDA backend.

## Status

I have already implemented reverse mode AD, tensor operations etc separately but want to package it up in this repo
over the next few weeks.
